## Description

GumTree is a complete framework to deal with source code as trees and compute differences between them. It includes possibilities such as:
* converting a source file into a language-agnostic tree format
* export the produced trees in various formats
* compute the differences between the trees
* export these differences in various formats
* visualize these differences graphically

Compared to classical code differencing tools, it has two important particularities:
* it works on a tree structure rather than a text structure,
* it can detect moved or renamed elements in addition of deleted and inserted elements.

Supported languages
